## About this site

This website present student submitting course evaluations on selected University of Washington classes, with the goal of helping incoming freshmen to build their best possible course schedules. This website is specially created for Chinese-speaking international students in UW, such as those from China and other Southeast Asian countries.

## My responsibility and contribution

- Refactored search page React Component to display results by parsing URL query parameters.
  - I am responsible for writing and improving these following files, relative to project source root.
  - `src/component/home/SearchResultPage.js`
  - `src/component/home/SearchResultPage.css`
  - `src/component/general/SearchFilter.js`
  - `src/component/general/SearchFilter.css`
- Refactored Node.js backend server to handle complex course search queries and prevent SQL injections.
  - Unfortunately, I could not share the site's back-end code repository due to information security concern in our project group.
- Design the site's home page and course detail page's appearance.
- Help other teammates to solve programming issues for site's Front-end and Back-end codes
  - For instance, I assist another teammate to embed `svg` XML content in a web page.

# Commands for developers to test and build this site

This front-end works the best if you have our Node.js back-end server running. Unfortunately, I could not share the site's back-end code repository due to information security concern in our project group.

## Getting Started with Organization of Hua Classmate's React front-end

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
